This section will describe four primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, the *IPython interpreter*, via *Self-contained Scripts*, or in the *Jupyter notebook*.\n\n*[Kaggle specific note: Kaggle supports the last two of these options; scripts and notebooks.]* "

We've ported this tutorial into kernels so that you can jump in and run or tinker with any of the code that you see. To do so, you'll first need to click the 'Fork Notebook' button in the upper right corner of the screen to create your own copy. You can then run any block of code, or cell, by clicking on it and then hitting shift + enter. Note that cells can be run in any order, but be prepared ]*  "
